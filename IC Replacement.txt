The **CD4011BE** is a quad 2-input NAND gate integrated circuit (IC) manufactured by Texas Instruments¹. It is part of the 4000B series and comes in a 14-DIP (Dual In-line Package) format¹. 

If you're looking for a replacement, you would typically want an IC that has the same functionality. In this case, that would be a quad 2-input NAND gate. The **HCF4011M013TR** from STMicroelectronics is a pin-to-pin replacement². It performs the same logic NAND function².

Please note that while these ICs have the same functionality, there might be differences in their electrical characteristics such as supply voltage, propagation delay, etc. Therefore, it's important to check the datasheets of both ICs to ensure compatibility with your specific application¹⁴.

The **SN74LS00** from Texas Instruments is a quad 2-input NAND gate IC¹. It is part of the 74LS series and uses low-power Schottky transistors to reduce the stored charge and achieve higher switching speeds than with conventional bipolar transistors¹²³⁵. It comes in a 14-pin package and each NAND gate has two inputs & one output²³⁵.

The **CD4066BE** is a quad bilateral switch integrated circuit (IC) manufactured by Texas Instruments¹. It is part of the 4000B series and comes in a 14-DIP (Dual In-line Package) format¹. 

If you're looking for a replacement, you would typically want an IC that has the same functionality. In this case, that would be a quad bilateral switch. The **CD4016** is very similar to the CD4066 and can act as a direct pin-to-pin replacement³.

Please note that while these ICs have the same functionality, there might be differences in their electrical characteristics such as supply voltage, propagation delay, etc. Therefore, it's important to check the datasheets of both ICs to ensure compatibility with your specific application¹².
